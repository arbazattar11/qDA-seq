# Step 1: Quality Control for qDA-seq Data
mkdir -p qc_reports
fastqc -o qc_reports/ *.fastq

# Step 2: Read Alignment for qDA-seq Data
bwa index reference_genome.fa
bwa mem -t 4 reference_genome.fa sample1.fastq sample2.fastq > aligned_reads.sam
samtools view -bS aligned_reads.sam | samtools sort -o aligned_reads.bam
samtools index aligned_reads.bam

# Step 3: Filtering of Aligned Reads
# Remove PCR duplicates and low-quality reads
samtools rmdup aligned_reads.bam filtered_reads.bam
samtools view -q 30 -b filtered_reads.bam > high_quality_reads.bam

# Step 4: Peak Calling for qDA-seq Data
# Identify differentially accessible regions using qDA-seq specific algorithms
# Example using qDAPeakFinder
# Example command: qDAPeakFinder -i high_quality_reads.bam -o peaks.bed -c conditions.txt

# Step 5: Annotation of Peaks
# Annotate the identified peaks with genomic features
# Example using BEDTools and annotatePeaks.pl
# Example command: bedtools intersect -a peaks.bed -b genomic_features.bed > annotated_peaks.bed

# Step 6: Visualization and Interpretation
# Visualize and interpret the identified differentially accessible regions to gain insights into chromatin accessibility changes
